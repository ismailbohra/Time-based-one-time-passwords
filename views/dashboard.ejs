      <h5>What is TOTP Authentication?</h5>
      <p>
        TOTP stands for <strong>Time-based One-Time Password</strong>. As the Wikipedia says, it is a computer algorithm that generates a one-time password (OTP) based on the current time.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a shared TOTP secret key between the user's phone and the app server, both can generate the same TOTP code at the same point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since TOTP generation relies on time, it can be calculated offline. The generated OTP is a numerical string, which is both simple and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        TOTP is commonly used as part of two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance the security of user accounts.

      <h5>How Does TOTP Work?</h5>
      <p>
        When users use TOTP as a 2FA method, they often use <strong>Authenticator Apps</strong> to store the TOTP secret. These apps automatically generate the TOTP codes.
        Popular Authenticator apps include <strong>Google Authenticator</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Authenticator</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process of implementing TOTP as a two-factor authentication method involves two main steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Binding the TOTP secret to the user:</strong> This step involves associating a unique TOTP secret with your user account.</li>
        <li><strong>Verifying the TOTP code:</strong> When logging in, you'll be asked to enter a TOTP code from your authenticator app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After binding the TOTP secret, you can use your authenticator app to generate and verify TOTP codes during future logins.
      </p>

      <h5>Binding TOTP to Your Account</h5>
      <p>
        To set up TOTP, follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download and install an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator on your phone.</li>
        <li>Scan the QR code provided during account setup to link the app to your account.</li>
        <li>Enter the TOTP code generated by the app to bind the TOTP secret to your account.</li>
      </ol>
